This project is a simple and responsive Weather Application developed as part of Task 1 – API Integration.
The application demonstrates how to fetch and display real-time weather data from a public API using JavaScript.

The user can enter the name of any city, and the application dynamically retrieves the current weather information such as temperature and wind speed. The project focuses on understanding API requests, handling JSON responses, and updating the user interface dynamically.
